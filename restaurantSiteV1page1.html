After being bored for a year in the biology program, John decided to drop out of school (much to his parent dismay) and follow his dream: to create one of the most amazing burgers on the planet!</p><p>After 40 years on Short St. in downton Austin, we invite you to come on down and enjoy some of our fantastic food choices. We are known for our burgers and fries, but we've many other delicious dishes as well!</p></td>
